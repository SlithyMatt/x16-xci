# XCI Inventory Template

# This is a minimal 1x2 inventory layout, even though only one item is defined.
# All spaces are done with tile 1, which is a plain white square, or an
# ASCII space in Text Style 1, which is a black background, in the case of the
# quantity display. Note that all margins and even the quantity and scroll bars
# are optional. The inventory will initially appear as:
# " $  100 ^"
# "        V"
