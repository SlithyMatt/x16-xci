# XCI Appendix: Configuration Walkthrough of the Example Game

The example game that comes with the XCI toolchain, "My Game", is not really a game so much as an exercise in game design for the sake of testing and instruction. A "real" game should be bigger and more complex, with an actual story, characters, action, problem solving, etc. More than minimal effort on creating graphics and sound would also be a good idea!

This guide is a level-by-level walkthrough of the game configuration, showing how XCI is used to build game mechanics and create sound and graphics.

## Top-Level Configuration
The [main documentation](../README.md) goes through all of the top-level configuration files for this game.

## Zone 0

Zone 0 was covered comprehensively in the [main documentation](../README.md). The [Zone File](../README.md#zone-files) itself is described in detail. In fact, this guide will skip over the remaining zone files as they pretty self-explanatory once you've seen one.

### Zone 0, Level 0

This level is covered in the main [**Level Files**](#level-files) documentation.

### Zone 0, Level 1

This level is covered in the [**More Level Examples**](#more-level-examples) sub-section of the main [**Level Files**](#level-files) documentation.

## Zone 1

Zone 1 is the first zone that is loaded after the start of the game. It has three levels that take place in other parts of the house and right outside the front door.
